## Project Overview
This project is a SwiftUI app demonstrating the use of **TabView** and **context menus**.  
It includes **three holiday-themed tabs**:

1. **Halloween** – features spooky decorations and a themed context menu.  
2. **Thanksgiving** – displays fall colors and interactive menu options.  
3. **New Year** – celebrates with a fireworks theme and celebratory actions.

Each tab contains:
- A unique theme and color scheme  
- An image with a **context menu** (activated via long-press)  
- Themed messages and SwiftUI views
